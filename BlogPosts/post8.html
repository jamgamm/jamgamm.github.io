                <p><br> Recently a show I was following called Produce 101 Japan (Season 3, The Girls) finished up and I thought I'd do a
                    small analysis on various parts of the show. For context, this show is part of the 'Produce Series' which is a kind of reality TV music
                    competition, sort of like The Voice or X Factor. There are 101 contestants and they compete to rank in the top 11 to make an 11 member JPOP group. 
                    The original show is from Korea, and this is the Japanese version. There's several rounds of performances (called battles or missions)
                    and after each round a certain amount of contestants are eliminated. Eliminations and ranks are based off of fan/viewer voting. The amount that 
                    make it through the rounds is: 101->50->35 ->20->11. The final winners of the show are now known as a group called ME:I. <br><br>
                    Anyway, that was a quick overview of what the show is about. I enjoyed the show and all the performances and contestants. So I decided to
                    use my skills that I've learned throughout school and work to do some analysis and visualize some small stats of the show for fun. <br><br>
                    First, for data collection I built a tool using Python to scrape the show's official website where the ranking for each week was displayed and put it into an Excel file.
                    I also collected data on what songs/teams each contestant was part of for each mission. Then I visualed the data using Power BI and some DAX to do a little extra calculations.<br><br>
                    Below is a small slideshow of a few of the visuals I had.<br><br>

                    <br>
                    Some fun little takeaways:<br>
                    <li>Out of the 11 final members, 7 of them were within the top 11 ranks every week.</li>
                    <li>From the 11 final members, Shizuku has the largest jump from 33 in week 6 to 20 in week 8. These weeks align with the time her position battle performance was aired (blonde Hero icon!).</li>
                    <li>From the group battle, Body and Soul Team 2 had the best success rate, with 6/6 members passing all the way to the concept battle. Then 
                        with 4/5 of the remaining members becoming debut members.
                    </li>
                    <li>Body and Soul overall had a pretty good passing rate. 6 of the debut members performed Body and Soul in the group battle (2 from Team 1 and 4 from Team 2).</li>
                    <li>Hype Boy Team 2 had the worst passing rate from the group battle, with 0 members passing the group battle.</li>
                    <li>6/7 members of the Run Run team pass the position battle, and 2/6 of the remaining members pass the concept battle. But both of them fail to pass the debut battle (noo Yuuki :'( )</li>
                    <li>Rocketeer is the only dance position team from the position battle with members passing the debut battle.</li>
                    <li>From the concept battle, &ME had the best success with 5/7 members becoming debut members.</li>
                    <li>Conversely, Popcorn had 0 members become debut members.</li>
                    <li>Ayane is best girl :^)</li>
