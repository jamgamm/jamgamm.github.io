                <p><br> Keykizaka46's song Sekai Ni Wa Ai Shika Nai (There is Only Love in the World) has a special place in my heart. 
                    From the instrumentals, flow, lyrics and music video I love all the parts of it! But in this post I wanted to focus on
                    the music video, which I think is their best one, and mainly about the use of turbines and the real facility featured in it. <br><br>

                    There are scenes that involve the members running and dancing in a field of turbines. This choice is used to create a strong visual 
                    of a natural scenery intersecting with something man-made and show society coexisting with nature. 
                    Wind turbines are specifically used because they're somthing that aren't seen in the big city. A very neat concept that is very Keyakizaka-like!
                    <br><br>
                    <div class="post__img-container">
                        <img src="../images/keyaki2.jpg" style="width:90%">
                    </div>
                    <br>
                    The actual turbines are at the Uehira Greenhill Wind Park, located in Tomamae, Hokkaido, Japan. This wind park is actually a collective 
                    name for 2 different wind facilities run by different companies, Eurus Energy's Tomamae Greenhill Wind Farm, and J-Power's Tomamae Winvilla Farm.
                    The farms had 20 and 19 turbines, totalling 39 that could be seen along the highway when driving by the coast of the town, so it's a popular tourist destination.
                    <br><br>
                    However the turbines in the video actually don't exist anymore! The video was filmed in 2016, but in 2022 and 2023 the turbines were replaced with different models.
                    Both wind farms took down all the turbines and replaced them with fewer, but higher capacity models, so the sites still had the same energy capacity
                    they previously had, but with less turbines. Eurus Energy replaced their 20 ~1MW turbines (Siemans Gamesa and Toshiba models) for 5 4.2MW (GE) ones in 2022. J-Power followed in 2023 with
                    replacing their 19 1.5~1.65MW turbines (Vestas and Enercon models) for 8 4.3MW (Siemans Gamesa) ones. Both farms had been operating for about 20 years with
                    their old models so it was about time to upgrade the technology.

                    <br><br>
                    And yet somehow the turbines actually outlived Keyaki, because they rebranded to Sakurazaka46 in 2020. Techi you'll always be famous!
